# Economy Design

## Overview
The economy governs how players earn and spend resources (gold) to build and upgrade towers. A balanced economy ensures strategic decision-making and pacing throughout the match.

## Gold Sources
- **Creep Bounty** – primary income, granted when creeps are defeated.
- **Wave Completion Bonus** – additional gold awarded when a wave is cleared.
- **Passive Interest** – periodic percentage-based income encouraging savings.
- **Objective Rewards** – optional goals or achievements that grant lump sums.

## Expenditures
- **Tower Construction** – initial cost to place a tower on the map.
- **Tower Upgrades** – enhances tower capabilities at escalating costs.
- **Abilities or Spells** – consumable actions that aid defense.
- **Selling** – recovers a portion (e.g., 75%) of a tower's total investment.

## Balance Considerations
- Costs and bounties scale with wave difficulty to maintain challenge.
- Interest rates and bonuses are tuned to prevent runaway economies.
- The economy should encourage planning: saving for powerful towers versus early investments.

## UI Feedback
- Gold amount is always visible to the player.
- Spending or earning gold triggers visual and audio cues.
- Tooltips display cost and refund information for each tower or upgrade.
